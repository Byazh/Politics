# Politics
In view of the next elections of the Italian Parliament, I decided to summarize each party's policies and compare them. I had never built a website before, so this is the result of a scarce week of learning HTML, CSS, JS and ReactJS. The below pictures and code snippets are just samples: I will upload the updated code when we finish the new website for the EU 2024 June elections!
